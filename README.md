A Generic IC2 API Tutorial Mod


If you are getting errors, please follow these steps:

1) Confirm versions are similar. If tutorial is outdated, try to find the new method. 99% of the time the method name or arguments have changed.

2) Double check code is identicle to the tutorial's. I will never release a tutorial or commit any changes with an error message. (Though if eclipse missed it, I might as well)

3) Comment. If it is a youtube tutorial, post details like error message, lines of code in question, current versions, etc. If you don't have a clue, pastebin the file in question and submit the link. (Sometimes youtube does not like links, so just say its a pastebin and submit the paste ID)
